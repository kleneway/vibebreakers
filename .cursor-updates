## 2024-12-28 - Time Traveler's Dilemma Game Implementation

Implemented Game 3 from the icebreaker games plan: "Time Traveler's Dilemma" - a complex decision-making game where players navigate through historical eras making choices that create ripple effects through time.

### Components Created:

- `TimeTravelGame.tsx` - Main game orchestrator with state management, timer system, and phase transitions

### Features Implemented:

- **Complex Decision Trees**: 6 historical eras with authentic scenarios and 4 choices each

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with dark mode support
