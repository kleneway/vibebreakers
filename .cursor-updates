## Story Building Symphony Game Implementation

Implemented Game 1: "Story Building Symphony" - a collaborative storytelling icebreaker game where players build a narrative together, with each person adding exactly one sentence while incorporating randomly assigned story elements (characters, settings, or plot devices).

### Key Features:
- **Component Structure**: Created modular components including StoryBuildingSymphony (main game), StoryPromptCard (story display), PlayerContributionPanel (input with speech-to-text), StoryElementGenerator (random element assignment), and Timer (countdown functionality)
- **Game Flow**: Setup phase (player management) → Playing phase (timed rounds) → Finished phase (winner celebration and story export)
- **Story Elements**: Pre-defined arrays of characters, settings, and plot devices for creative storytelling
- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Leveraged existing SpeechToTextArea component for accessibility
- **Validation**: Sentence validation including length checks, punctuation, and element incorporation
- **Scoring System**: Points awarded for creativity, story integration, and element incorporation
- **Export Functionality**: Download completed stories as text files
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with dark mode support

### Technical Implementation:
- Added comprehensive TypeScript types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Enhanced Button component with disabled state support
- Created dedicated game page at `/games/story-building-symphony`
- Added Storybook stories for component documentation
- Updated main page with game selection interface

### Game Mechanics:
- 45-second timer per turn (configurable)
- 20-200 character sentence length limits
- Maximum 10 rounds per game
